# Simple Entity Framework Code First ASP.MVC Application
A simple ASP.net MVC website, using an Entity Framework Code First Approach. I kept it simple for people just learning how to work with entity framework. It lists, saves, updates, and deletes from a simple table called 'customers'. It uses a view model to organize the properties and collections that will be needed by the controller. There is one controller, one view model and one domain object.
